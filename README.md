he onboarding screens present key features of the app through a series of visually engaging slides, which can include images, text, and even interactive elements. By leveraging the intro_screen_onboarding_flutter package, developers can easily customize the flow, style

Furthermore, the package supports various configurations, such as skipping the onboarding for returning users.
